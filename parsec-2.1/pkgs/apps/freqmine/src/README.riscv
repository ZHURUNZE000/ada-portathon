Building and running freqmine for RISC-V:
1) Set environment variable "riscvgpp" to the appropriate path for the system's RISC-V C++ compiler
2) Build with "make clean && make riscv"
3) Run with:
    a) Emulation: "<RISC-V qemu path> freqmine <infile> <MINSUP> [<outfile>]", parameters the same as running on x86
    b) Native RISC-V: same as native x86
4) To rebuild for x86, "make clean && make"
