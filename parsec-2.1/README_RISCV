This is an ongoing project to port parsec to RISC-V. 
So far we have Blackscholes, Fluidanimate, Freqmine, Streamcluster, and Swaptions working.

Note: This README is intended to supplement the README in this folder and not replace it. 

## Building

Building works as normal with the original Parsec 2.1 suite. Set your cross-compiler
in the config/gcc.bldconf file. You need set variables with full paths to binaries, e.g., set
CXX for g++ binary path, CC for gcc binary path, etc.

Then, to build, go to the bin folder and, on the command line, enter:

_./parsecmgmt -a build -p [benchmark_name]_


## Running

To run, go to the bin folder, enter:

_./parsecmgmt -a run -p [benchmark_name] -s [run_environment] -i [input size] -n [num_threads]_

For run environment, we tested with RISC-V QEMU emulator using usermode.

Between builds for different platforms, you must uninstall the previous build.

_./parsecmgmt -a uninstall -p [benchmark_name]_
