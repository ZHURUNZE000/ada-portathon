Needed to regenerate configure file.
Needed to install libaudio-dev for audio library
Needed to install osspd-alsa for /dev/dsp
The original device id /dev/sbdsp but newer version use /dev/dsp so we need to change the defaul path.

To compile for x86:
    autoconf
    ./configure linux
    make say
    make nasay

There is no audiolib for riscv.

(Theoretical) To compiler for riscv:
    autoconf
    ./configure linux
    make CC=$riscvgcc CPPFLAGS="-I ." say	<-- won't run correctly, needs an audio device
    make CC=$riscvgcc CPPFLAGS="-I ." nasay	<-- doesn't work needs libaudio
