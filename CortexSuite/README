Compile the benchmarks with the command:

_make compile_

This will compile the benchmarks for the small,medium,and large benchmarks
where applicable. 

To run a specific set of benchmarks use the commands

_make run-small_
_make run-medium_
_make run-large_

To gather the cycle counts for all of these algorithms run

_make cycles_

This will print the cycle count for small, medium, and large datasets if applicable
for each algorithm
