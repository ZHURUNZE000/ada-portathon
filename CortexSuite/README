##Compile the benchmarks with the command [native mode]:

_make compile_

This will compile the benchmarks for the small,medium,and large benchmarks
where applicable. 

To run a specific set of benchmarks use the commands

_make run-small_
_make run-medium_
_make run-large_

To gather the cycle counts for all of these algorithms run

_make cycles_

This will print the cycle count for small, medium, and large datasets if applicable
for each algorithm

##Compile the benchmarks with the command [cross-compilation mode]

To cross-compile the benchmarks for RISC-V, run the make command with the following parameters:
`CC=<path/to/riscvgcc cross-compiler> riscv=1`

Example:
To compile the "lda" benchmark: `make compile CC=$riscvgcc riscv=1`
